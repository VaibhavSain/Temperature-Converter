🚀 Just Launched a New Mini Project! 🌡️
🔥 Temperature Converter — Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋
I'm excited to share my latest project — a Temperature Converter that lets users convert values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin effortlessly in real time. 💻⚙️

This tool is a simple yet effective way to showcase the power of vanilla JavaScript in creating dynamic, interactive web apps.

✅ Built Using:
🔹 HTML for structure
🔹 CSS for clean and responsive design
🔹 JavaScript for conversion logic and DOM manipulation

💡 Why this project?
To strengthen my front-end fundamentals and build tools that solve everyday problems.
